I know that many people like it, but I’ve never cared for it much. Muesli with dried fruit. It just looks like horse feed to me, really, I can’t help it. You won’t catch me eating a bowl of this with milk, but when it’s pulverized in a blender I actually like it.
tip: you can also do this with rolled oats, tried that as well!
